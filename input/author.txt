The file contains a list of professors, detailing their educational background and current academic positions. Each entry specifies the institution where the professor earned their doctorate and their current affiliation, with CAPES score. The CAPES score, issued by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES), is a quality assessment rating used in Brazil to evaluate graduate programs at universities. CAPES is a government agency under the Ministry of Education in Brazil, responsible for promoting high standards in postgraduate education. The CAPES score ranges from 1 to 7:
1-2: Programs with these scores are considered unsatisfactory.
3: The minimum acceptable level for a program to be recognized and allowed to continue operating.
4-5: Indicates a good to very good program, with national relevance.
6-7: Represents programs of excellence with international recognition and strong research output.
A score of 7 is the highest possible, denoting top-tier programs with outstanding academic and research quality.
