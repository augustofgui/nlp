The file contains a list of institutions, detailing their name, city and country and current academic prestige metrics of h-index and i10-index. Each entry specifies the institutions informations. The h-index measures both the productivity and citation impact of a researcher’s published work. An individual has an h-index of h if they have published h papers that have each been cited at least h times. For example, an h-index of 10 means the researcher has 10 papers with at least 10 citations each. It helps to balance the number of publications with the number of citations, providing a more nuanced view of a researcher’s impact than simply counting citations or publications alone. The i10-index is simpler. It counts the number of papers with at least 10 citations. For example, if a researcher has 15 papers with at least 10 citations each, their i10-index is 15. It’s a straightforward measure of the number of influential papers.
