Each entry specifies the institutions informations. The h-index measures both the productivity and citation impact of a researcher\u2019s published work. An individual has an h-index of h if they have published h papers that have each been cited at least h times. For example, an h-index of 10 means the researcher has 10 papers with at least 10 citations each. It helps to balance the number of publications with the number of citations, providing a more nuanced view of a researcher\u2019s impact than simply counting citations or publications alone. The i10-index is simpler. It counts the number of papers with at least 10 citations. For example, if a researcher has 15 papers with at least 10 citations each, their i10-index is 15. It\u2019s a straightforward measure of the number of influential papers.\n\n\nUniversity of Stuttgart is a institution in Stuttgart, Germany, with an h-index score of 374 and i10-index of 28109.\nUniversidade Federal de Juiz de Fora is a institution in Juiz de Fora, Brazil, with an h-index score of 134 and i10-index of 5187.\nUniversit\u00e9 Paris-Sud is a institution in Orsay, France, with an h-index score of 504 and i10-index of 37055.\nKarlsruhe Institute of Technology is a institution in Karlsruhe, Germany, with an h-index score of 420 and i10-index of 39508.\nUniversit\u00e9 de Technologie de Compi\u00e8gne is a institution in Compi\u00e8gne, France, with an h-index score of 159 and i10-index of 3326.\nUniversidade Estadual do Cear\u00e1 is a institution in Fortaleza, Brazil, with an h-index score of 89 and i10-index of 2367.\nUniversity of California, Riverside is a institution in Riverside, United States, with an h-index score of 493 and i10-index of 39243.\nInstitut polytechnique de Grenoble is a institution in Grenoble, France, with an h-index score of 191 and i10-index of 5560.\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Aeron\u00e1utica is a institution in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, Brazil, with an h-index score of 97 and i10-index of 1963.\nUniversidade Federal de Ouro Preto is a institution in Ouro Preto, Brazil, with an h-index score of 119 and i10-index of 3424.\nUniversity of Pisa is a institution in Pisa, Italy, with an h-index score of 420 and i10-index of 44759.\nUniversity of Essex is a institution in Colchester, United Kingdom, with an h-index score of 311 and i10-index of 13276.\nUniversidade Federal de Minas Gerais is a institution in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, with an h-index score of 286 and i10-index of 31017.\nBoston University is a institution in Boston, United States, with an h-index score of 788 and i10-index of 81787.\nUniversity of East Anglia is a institution in Norwich, United Kingdom, with an h-index score of 458 and i10-index of 24986.\nNorthwestern University is a institution in Evanston, United States, with an h-index score of 842 and i10-index of 109820.\n\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon is a institution in Lyon, France, with an h-index score of 271 and i10-index of 9274.\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is a institution in Chapel Hill, United States, with an h-index score of 866 and i10-index of 113722.\nTokyo Institute of Technology is a institution in Tokyo, Japan, with an h-index score of 401 and i10-index of 51123.\nUniversity of Southern California is a institution in Los Angeles, United States, with an h-index score of 796 and i10-index of 105579.\nUniversity of Bern is a institution in Bern, Switzerland, with an h-index score of 549 and i10-index of 53342.\nUniversidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro is a institution in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with an h-index score of 311 and i10-index of 37811.\nUniversity of Modena and Reggio Emilia is a institution in Modena, Italy, with an h-index score of 310 and i10-index of 21124.\nUniversidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul is a institution in Campo Grande, Brazil, with an h-index score of 113 and i10-index of 3722.\nUniversitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona is a institution in Cerdanyola del Vall\u00e8s, Spain, with an h-index score of 426 and i10-index of 45875.\nUniversidade Estadual de Maring\u00e1 is a institution in Maring\u00e1, Brazil, with an h-index score of 159 and i10-index of 8416.\nT\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris is a institution in Paris, France, with an h-index score of 159 and i10-index of 3002.\nUniversity of London is a institution in London, United Kingdom, with an h-index score of 489 and i10-index of 35729.\nUniversidade Federal da Bahia is a institution in Salvador, Brazil, with an h-index score of 182 and i10-index of 10534.\nUniversidade Federal do Rio Grande is a institution in Rio Grande, Brazil, with an h-index score of 145 and i10-index of 4695.\nUniversidade Estadual de Londrina is a institution in Londrina, Brazil, with an h-index score of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
