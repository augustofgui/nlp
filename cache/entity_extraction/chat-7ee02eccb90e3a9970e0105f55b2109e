The CAPES score, issued by the Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior (CAPES), is a quality assessment rating used in Brazil to evaluate graduate programs at universities. CAPES is a government agency under the Ministry of Education in Brazil, responsible for promoting high standards in postgraduate education. The CAPES score ranges from 1 to 7:\n1-2: Programs with these scores are considered unsatisfactory.\n3: The minimum acceptable level for a program to be recognized and allowed to continue operating.\n4-5: Indicates a good to very good program, with national relevance.\n6-7: Represents programs of excellence with international recognition and strong research output.\nA score of 7 is the
